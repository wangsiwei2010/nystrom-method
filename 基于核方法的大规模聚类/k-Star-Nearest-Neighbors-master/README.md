# k-Star-Nearest-Neighbors
Code for k*-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm which appears in:

k*-Nearest Neighbors: From Global to Local, by Oren Anava and Kfir Yehuda Levy, NIPS 2016
http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6373-k-nearest-neighbors-from-global-to-local.pdf


The algorithm appears in kStarNN.mÂ 
To run and compare the performance with K-NN/Nadaraya-Watson you can run the Main.m file 
(there are three example datasets: Yacht, Diabetes and Sonar).
